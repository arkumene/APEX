# APEX
This is a project proposal to build a system that can leverage the efficiency of Data science algorithms in the Stock market Domain. To build a python system, that assists a potential buyer to analyze a chosen stock ticker and determine next dayâ€™s share price. Few indicators that can be taken into account that might significantly affect a stock price are Daily news headlines, volume, Relative strength Index, P/E ratio, etc. 
Input will be the ticker symbol that we want to predict the stock price for and output can be one of the predicted prices for the next day, possibly the open/ close price for the next day. Expectation is to design and build a regression algorithm that calculates a future price based on the past prices and technical indicators. Standard Root Mean Square error can be calculated as a measure of accuracy.
